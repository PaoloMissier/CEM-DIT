abstract = {Scientific collaboration increasingly involves data sharing between separate groups. We consider a scenario where data products of scientific workflows are published and then used by other researchers as inputs to their workflows. For proper interpretation, shared data must be complemented by descriptive metadata. We focus on provenance traces, a prime example of such metadata which describes the genesis and processing history of data products in terms of the computational workflow steps. Through the reuse of published data, virtual, implicitly collaborative experiments emerge, making it desirable to compose the independently generated traces into global ones that describe the combined executions as single, seamless experiments. We present a model for provenance sharing that realizes this holistic view by overcoming the various interoperability problems that emerge from the heterogeneity of workflow systems, data formats, and provenance models. At the heart lie (i) an abstract workflow and provenance model in which (ii) data sharing becomes itself part of the combined workflow. We then describe an implementation of our model that we developed in the context of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) project and that can “stitch together” traces from different Kepler and Taverna workflow runs. It provides a prototypical framework for seamless cross-system, collaborative provenance management and can be easily extended to include other systems. Our approach also opens the door to new ways of workflow interoperability not only through often elusive workflow standards but through shared provenance information from public repositories.},

abstract = {A scientific workflow often deals with proprietary modules as well as private or confidential data, such as health or medical information. Hence providing exact answers to provenance queries over all executions of the workflow may reveal private information. In this paper we first study the potential privacy issues in a scientific workflow -- module privacy, data privacy, and provenance privacy, and frame several natural questions: (i) can we formally analyze module, data or provenance privacy giving provable privacy guarantees for an unlimited/bounded number of provenance queries? (ii) how can we answer provenance queries, providing as much information as possible to the user while still guaranteeing the required privacy? Then we look at module privacy in detail and propose a formal model from our recent work in [11]. Finally we point to several directions for future work.},
