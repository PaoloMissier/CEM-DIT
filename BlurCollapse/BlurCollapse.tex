\mnote{main contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item two graph rewriting operators for abstracting over provenance graphs, formalised and with proof that the rewriting preserves PROV validity
	\item algebraic properties of the operators (commutative??)
	\item small PROV extension to introduce new relationships when the existing ones are generalised i.e. to ``influence'', that is the new relationship types qualify ``influence''
	
	\item demonstration of how the operators support a variety of abstraction policies and how we cna use a variety of graph metrics to measure the effect of applying a specific policy to a graph
	\item empirical evaluation of the rewriting i.e. using (1) a variety of synthetic graphs, generated using ProvGen, (2) a variety of policies chosen as representative examples and (3) a variety of provenance network metrics
\end{itemize}
