As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:contributions}, our goal is to define graph editing operators that selectively remove information from a graph $G \in \guEA$, yielding a new graph $G' \in \guEA$.
%
The first of these, namely the removal of labels or annotations associated with a node or an edge, is straightforward. 
%
Regarding the removal of a node, we note that simply reconnecting the remaining nodes generally may lead to an invalid graph. 
%
A simple example is a graph defined by: $\{\used(a, e_1)$, $\wgby(e_2, a) \}$ where activity $a$ is removed. This results simply in two disconnected nodes $e_1$, $e_2$, because no relationship can be inferred between them from the original graph.


Rather than delving into the possible consequences of such node and edge elision, we are going to focus exclusively on the $\group$ graph transformation operator as the prime way to achieve abstraction over provenance graphs.
%
$\group$ takes a graph $G = (V, E) \in \guEA$ and a subset $V_{gr} \subset V$ of its nodes \jwb{that the user wishes to obfuscate} and produces a modified graph $G' \in \guEA$. The nodes in $V_{gr}$ are ``grouped'' together and replaced by a new single node.
%
  
\[ \group : \guEA \times \mathbb{P}(V) \rightarrow \guEA \]
  
%Here we define $\group$ over $\guEA$ graphs. This will be extended to abstraction over Agents in Sec.~\ref{sec:agents-abstraction}.

%The $\group$ operator has the following signature:

%
As the operator is closed under composition, further abstraction can be achieved by repeated grouping, either on multiple disjoint sets $V_{gr}$, or on sets that include abstract nodes (abstraction of abstraction).



%
To get a quick intuition of the  problems faced in the definition of the grouping operator, consider the transformation in Fig.~\ref{fig:non-convex-ex-1}, where nodes $V_{gr} = \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5\}$ are simply replaced with new node $e'$ in the example graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:baseline-ug-ae}, and all edges in and out of nodes in $V_{gr}$ are just ``rewired'' in and out of $e'$. 



\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{figures/non-convex-ex-1.pdf} 
\caption{A naive replacement of a set of nodes may lead to a non-$\guEA$ graph.} \label{fig:non-convex-ex-1}
\end{figure*}

This naive replacement leads to problems. Firstly, it introduces two cycles: $e'  \leftrightarrow a_1$ and $e'  \leftrightarrow a_3$. Furthermore, the two edges 
$e'  \leftarrow a_1$ and $e'  \leftarrow a_3$ cannot be of type $\wgby$, while at the same time one cannot arbitrarily introduce $\used$ relations, which would be false dependencies.
%the new node $e'$ appears to have been generated by two distinct activities, $a_1$ and $a_3$.
Thus, the resulting graph is not a valid PROV graph. Note that the former of these problems had been already pointed out in the description of the ProPub system~\citep{springerlink:10.1007/978-3-642-22351-8_13}, mentioned above.

\subsection{Closure and homogeneous grouping}
\label{sec:closure}

The example suggests that the \jwb{issue} is caused by nodes $a_1$ and $a_3$, which both lie on the paths between two of the nodes in $V_{gr}$. Intuitively, set $V_{gr}$ is not ``convex'', that is, there are paths in $G$ that lead out of $V_{gr}$ and then back in again. This observation suggests the introduction of a preliminary closure operation \textit{pclos}, which ensures acyclicity by capturing \jwb{and including these paths}. It is defined as follows.

%%%%
%% closure
%%%%
\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{definition}[Path Closure]
\label{def:clos}
Let $G = (V,E) \in \guEA$ be a provenance graph, and let $V_{gr} \subset V$.  
For each pair  $v_i, v_j \in V_{gr}$ such that there \jwb{one or more directed paths} $v_i \leadsto v_j$ in $G$, let $V_{ij} \subset V$ be the set of all nodes in \jwb{all paths $v_i \leadsto v_j$}.
The Path Closure of $V_{gr}$ in $G$ is
\[\clos(V_{gr}, \jwb{G})  =  \bigcup_{v_i, v_j \in V_{gr}} V_{ij} \]
\end{definition}
\jwb{At this point, we make the assumption that, if $G$ is viewed as an \emph{undirected} graph, $\clos(V_{gr}, G)$ results in a single \emph{connected component} of the undirected graph. We explore the implications of relaxing this assumption later in the paper.} \comment{reference foward needed.}


\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{figures/convex-ex-1.pdf} 
\caption{Path closure and replacement with extension on a set of entity nodes.} \label{fig:convex-ex-1}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1} shows a continuation of the previous example. This time the replacement is performed on $\clos(\{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5\},G) = \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5, a_1, a_3\}$, \jwb{(in Fig.}~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(b)),  resulting in graph \jwb{in Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(c).}
%
However, while this solves the cycle problem, the graph is no longer bipartite, \jwb{because} the new edges $e' \rightarrow e_2$ and $e' \rightarrow e_6$ connect nodes of the same type.
%
In this example, we can construct a new group of nodes, $\{ e', e_2, e_6\}$, on the graph that results from the first replacement, and replace it with a new node $e''$. The resulting graph \jwb{Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(d)} is a valid $\guEA$ graph.

%
The same result can be obtained by first \textit{extending} the closure in \jwb{Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(b)} to include e-nodes $e_2$, $e_6$, and then replacing the resulting set with $e''$ (this is indicated by the ``extend and replace'' arrow from \jwb{Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(b)} to \jwb{Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}(d) as} shown).
%
Following this approach, we are going to define grouping as a composition of three functions: \textit{closure}, defined above, \textit{extension}, and \textit{replacement}, as follows.

%
The \textit{extension} of a set $V_{gr} \subset V$ relative to type $t \in \{ \en, \act \}$ is $V_{gr}$ augmented with all its adjacent nodes, in either direction, of type $t$. Formally:

%%%%

\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{definition}[$\extend$]
Let $G = (V,E) \in \guEA$, $t \in \{ \en, \act \}$.
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\extend(V_{gr}, G ,t) =  \\
\quad V_{gr} \;\cup \\ 
\quad    \{ v' | (v \leftarrow v') \in E \wedge v \in V_{gr} \wedge \type(v') = t \} \;\cup \\
\quad   \{ v | (v' \leftarrow v) \in E \wedge v \in V_{gr} \wedge \jwb{\type(v) = t} \}  \\
\end{array}
\]
\comment{The nodes we include must have the type $t$. It isn't possible to include a node of type other than t.}

\comment{To make this more clear, we could include $v'\nin V_{gr}$ in the definition of $extend$. This would also make this definition more compatible with the definitions of incut and outcut.}
\end{definition}

\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{definition}[$\extend2$]
Let $G = (V,E) \in \guEA$, $t \in \{ \en, \act \}$. $v_h$ and $v_t$ are the head and tail nodes of a relationship.
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\extend(V_{gr}, G ,t) =  \\
\quad V_{gr} \;\cup \\ 
\quad    \{ v_h | (v_h \leftarrow v_t) \in E \wedge v_t \in V_{gr} \wedge \type(v_h) = t \} \;\cup \\
\quad   \{ v_t | (v_h \leftarrow v_t) \in E \wedge v_h \in V_{gr} \wedge \jwb{\type(v_h) = t} \}  \\
\end{array}
\]




\end{definition}


%
In our example, $\extend(\{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5, a_1, a_3\}, G, \en) = \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5, a_1, a_3, e_2, e_6\}$.  Note that all sink nodes in $\extend(V_{gr}, G, t)$ are of type $t$ by construction.\footnote{A sink node is any node in the extended set with a link to a node not in the set.}


Next, we consider replacing the collected nodes with a new abstract node.
%
Let $G=(V,E)$, $V^* \subset V$ be obtained using $\extend$, and let $v_{new}$ be a new node symbol that does not appear in $V$, created using $\pclos$ then $\extend$. 
Function $\repl$ replaces $V^*$ with $v_{new}$ in $V$, and connects $v_{new}$ to the rest of the graph, as follows.

Let $\vartheta_{out}(V^*)$ denote the \textit{outcut} of $G$ associated with $V^*$:
\[ \vartheta_{out}(V^*) = \{  (v' \leftarrow v) |  v \in V \setminus V^*, v' \in  V^* \}\]
This is the set of arcs of $G$ leading out of $V^*$, i.e., whose heads lie in $V^*$ and whose tails lie in $V \setminus V^*$. 
%
Symmetrically, let $\vartheta_{in}(V^*)$ denote the \textit{incut}  of $G$ associated with $V^*$, i.e., the set of arcs of $G$ leading into $V^*$:
\[ \vartheta_{in}(V^*) = \{  (v\leftarrow v') |  v \in V^*, v' \in  V \setminus V^* \}\]
Finally, let $\vartheta_{int}(V^*) = \{ (v \leftarrow v') \in E | v, v' \in V^* \}$ denote internal arcs, that connect two nodes inside $V^*$:
\[ \vartheta_{int}(V^*) = \{  (v\leftarrow v') |  v, v' \in V^*\}\]


\comment{Function $\repl$ replaces each arc $(v \leftarrow v') \in \vartheta_{out}(V^*)$ with a new arc $(v \leftarrow v_{new})$ of the same type, and replaces each arc $(v \leftarrow v') \in \vartheta_{in}(V^*)$ with a new arc $(v_{new} \leftarrow v)$ of the same type. Arcs in $\vartheta_{int}(V^*)$ simply disappear along with the nodes in $V^*$.}
%


It is easy to verify that the resulting graph is type-correct.
\comment{There is no resulting graph at this point}
Indeed, all sink nodes in \jwb{$V^*$}  are of the \jwb{same type $t$,} as noted above, and so is $v_{new}$ by construction. Thus, sink nodes are replaced by a node $v_{new}$ of the same type. Since the arcs have the same type as those they replace, it follows that $\repl$ preserves type correctness.
%

\begin{definition}
  Let $ty \in \{\used,  \wgby\}$. Then:
  \begin{align*}
\vartheta_{out}'(V^*) = \{ & \jwb{(}v \xleftarrow{ty}  v_{new} \jwb{)}|  v \xleftarrow{ty} v' \in \vartheta_{out}(V^*)  \}  \\
\vartheta_{in}'(V^*) = \{ & \jwb{(}v_{new} \xleftarrow{ty} v \jwb{)} | v' \xleftarrow{ty} v \in \vartheta_{in}(V^*)  \}   
\end{align*}

We can now provide an initial definition of our $\group$ operator, under the simplifying assumption that all nodes in $V_{gr}$ are of the same type, either $\en$ or $\act$, which we denote by $\type(V_{gr})$ (with a slight abuse of notation). Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-a-only} shows a progression similar to that of Fig.~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1}, but this time $\type(v) = \act$ for each $v \in V_{gr} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$, and $V_{gr}$ is replaced by another activity node, $a'$.
%
Under assumption of type homogeneity, the grouping operator is a functional composition of $\clos$, $\extend$, and $\repl$ functions, defined as follows.

\vspace*{10pt}
\begin{definition}[Homogeneous Grouping]
Let $G=(V,E) \in \guEA$, $V_{gr} \in V$ be a type-homogeneous set, and let $v_{new}$ be a new node with $\type(v_{new}) = \type(V_{gr})$.
\begin{align*}
\group_{hom} &  (G, V_{gr}, v_{new}) = \\
 & \repl(  \\
 & \extend( \\
 & \clos(V_{gr},\jwb{G}), V, \type(V_{gr})), v_{new},  G ) 
\end{align*}
\label{def:homo-group}
\end{definition}

As an illustration, in our running example in Figure~\ref{fig:convex-ex-1} we have: %Ive altered this example: see latex for orig.
\begin{align*}
V_{gr} &= \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5\} \\
V_{cl} & = \clos(V_{gr},G) = \{e_1, e_3, e_4, e_5, a_1, a_3\} \\
V' & = \extend(V_{cl}, \en) = V_{cl} \cup  \{e_2, e_6 \} \\
\group_e(G, V_{gr}, v_{new}) & = \repl(V', v_{new}, G) \\
& = (\{a_1,a_2,a_3,e''\}, \{ (a_2, e''), (a_4, e''), (e'',a_5) \})
\end{align*}

\subsection{Generalization to \textit{e-grouping} and \textit{a-grouping}}

So far we have considered grouping over sets $V_{gr}$ of type-homogeneous nodes (before closure). Additional care must be taken if we allow $V_{gr}$ to include nodes of mixed types. First, the type of the replacement node must now be specified, as it is no longer implied from the type of the nodes in $V_{gr}$. Indeed, the choice of such type leads to different abstracted graphs. Thus, we will now refer to grouping as \textit{t-grouping}, where $t \in \{ \en, \act\}$, i.e., \textbf{e-grouping} or \textbf{a-grouping}. Fig.~\ref{fig:e2-a4}(a-1, a-2) illustrates the application of the $\group_{hom}$ operator (Def.~\ref{def:homo-group}), assuming \textit{a-grouping} and $V_{gr} = \{ e_4, a_2\}$. Note that the extension incorporates activity node $a_1$. 

Second, observe that a new pattern arises in the case of \textit{e-grouping} as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:e2-a4}(e-1, e-2). Now the extension leads to $V_{cl} = V_{gr} \cup \{ e_5\}$, which in turn leads to the pattern shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:e2-a4}(e-2), involving two generation events for the new entity $e_{N}$.

Although this is a valid pattern, the two generation events must be simultaneous (this is one of the temporal constraints defined in~\citep{w3c-prov-constraints}):
\begin{align*}
ev(\wgby(e_N, a_1)) & \preorder ev(\wgby(e_N, a_3))  \quad \wedge \\
ev(\wgby(e_N, a_3)) & \preorder ev(\wgby(e_N, a_1))
\end{align*}

The intuitive interpretation for this pattern is that each of the two activities generated one entity in the group represented by $e_N$, and that the abstraction makes these two events indistinguishable. Formally, nothing further needs to be done to the graph. However note that one can restore, if desired, the more natural pattern whereby one single generation event is recorded for $e_N$. This is achieved simply by propagating the grouping to the set of generating activities. In the example, this leads to the graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:e2-a4}(e-3).  


\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{figures/e2-a4.pdf} 
\caption{e-grouping and a-grouping on mixed type nodes} \label{fig:e2-a4}
\end{figure*}

We now formalize these considerations by introducing two definitions for $\group$. The first, which we call \textbf{t-grouping}, is agnostic of multiple generation patterns, while the second (\textbf{strict t-grouping}) applies propagation to ensure that the graph is free from multiple generation patterns.

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{definition}[t-Grouping]
\label{def:t-grouping}
Let $G=(V,E) \in \guEA$, $V_{gr} \in V$, $t \in \{\en, \act\}$, and let  $v_{new}$ be a new node with $\type(v_{new}) = t$.
%
Then:
\begin{align*} 
\group & (G, V_{gr}, v_{new}, t) = \\
& \repl( \extend(\clos(V_{gr},\jwb{G}), V, t), v_{new},  G )
\end{align*}
\label{eq:t-grouping}
\end{definition}

Note that the assumption that sink nodes in the closure are homogeneous and are replaced by a node of the same type $t$, which is necessary for $\repl$ to perform correctly, still holds in this case.

\begin{definition}[Strict t-Grouping]
Given 
$G=(V,E) \in \guEA$, $V_{gr} \in V$, $t \in \{\en, \act\}$, and a new node $v_{new}$ with $\type(v_{new}) = t$, let
\[ G' = (V',E') = \group(G, V_{gr}, v_{new}, t). \]
Let 
$V_{gen} = \{ a \in V' |  a \xleftarrow{\wgby} v_{new} \in E' \}$ be the set of activity nodes that generate $v_{new}$ according to $G'$, and let $a_{new}$ be a new activity node. Then:
\begin{equation*}
%\footnotesize
\sgroup(G, V_{gr},v_{new}, t)=
\begin{cases}
G' & \!\text{if}  |\!V_{gen}\!| \leq 1  \\
\repl(V_{gen}, a_{new}, G') & \!\text{otherwise } 
\end{cases}
%\normalsize
\end{equation*}
\label{def:strict-t-grouping}
\end{definition}

% \begin{align*}
% \sgroup & (G, V_{gr},v_{new}, t)=\\%
% & \begin{cases}
%     G' & \!\text{if}  |\!V_{gen}\!| \leq 1  \\
%     \repl(V_{gen}, a_{new}, G') & \!\text{otherwise } 
%   \end{cases}
% \end{align*}
% 
% 

%\jwb{if a1 and a3 were linked via an intermediate entity node, would this be a problem?}

It is straightforward to show that strict t-grouping reduces to normal grouping if the grouping is a homogeneous a-grouping:
\begin{align*}
&\text{if } \type(t) =  \act \\
 &\qquad\text{then } \sgroup(G, V_{gr},t) = \group(G, V_{gr},t). 
\end{align*}
%
%
%In addition, however, they are also subject to ordering constraints relative to events associated to elements in in $V_{cl}$ (the set of nodes to be grouped, resulting from Path Closure on source graph $G'$), which have now been replaced by the grouping nodes. To illustrate this reasoning, consider for instance the simple graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:simple-prototype-pattern-events}(a), and let $V_{gr}= \{ e_1, e_2\}$. The ordering constraints on $G$ are as follows:

%The corresponding ordering constraints on $G'$ are as follows.

%gen_{ev}(\wgby(e_N, a_1))  \preorder usage_{ev}(\used(a_3,e_N)) \label{eq:constraints-example-n} 
%\end{align}
%
%The following additional ordering constraints further characterize events in $G'$ in terms of events in $G$. It is easy to see that such constraints are sufficient conditions for the constraints \ref{eq:constraints-example-1}-\ref{eq:constraints-example-n} above to hold.
%\begin{align*}
%usage_{ev}(\used(a_2,e_1)) \preorder usage_{ev}(\used(a_2,e_N))  \\

%gen_{ev}(\wgby(e_N, a_1)) \preorder gen_{ev}(\wgby(e_2, a_1)) )
%\end{align*}
%
%A similar reasoning applies to the case of a-grouping, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:simple-prototype-pattern-events}(b), where the following definitions are consistent with the temporal orderings:
%\begin{align*}
%usage_{ev}(\used(a_1,e_1)) \preorder usage_{ev}(\used(a_N,e_1))  \\
%usage_{ev}(\used(a_2,e_1) ) \preorder usage_{ev}(\used(a_N,e_1))  \\
%gen_{ev}(\wgby(e_2, a_N))  \preorder  gen_{ev}(\wgby(e_2, a_1)) \\

%start_{ev}(a_N) \preorder start_{ev}(a_1) \\

%end_{ev}(a_1) \preorder end_{ev}(a_N)  \\
%end_{ev}(a_2) ) \preorder end_{ev}(a_N)  
%\end{align*}
%
%Following this reasoning, we define the following additional ordering constraints amongst events in $G'$ and $G$ events.
