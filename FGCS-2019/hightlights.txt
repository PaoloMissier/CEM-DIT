* Development of an operator to carry out privacy-focused partial obfuscation of provenance

* Our work maps a PROV document P1 to a new abstract version P2, ensuring that (i) P2 is a valid PROV document and that the dependencies that appear in P2 are justified by those that appear in P1. 

* These two properties ensure that further abstraction of abstract PROV documents possible. 

* A guiding principle of the work is that of minimum damage: the resultant graph is altered as little as possible, while ensuring that the two properties are maintained.
