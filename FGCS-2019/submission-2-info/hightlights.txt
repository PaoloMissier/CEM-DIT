* Provides a way of partially obfuscating provenance using an operator that maps from a PROV document to a new abstract version such that if the first document satisfies a constraint C then the abstract version also satisfies C, and the dependencies that appear in the abstract version are justified by those in the original document.

* Provides a proof of the above properties.

* Provides a proof of closure with respect to composition.
