\section{Introduction}

\paolo{
The provenance of data is a form of structured metadata that records the processes involved in data production. In addition to references to data generation or transformation processes, a \textit{provenance trace} typically includes input  or intermediate data products as well as references to \textit{agents}, that is the humans or software systems who were responsible to enact those processes.
%
	In multi-party collaboration settings that involve data sharing, as well as in third party auditing of data and processes, there is a broad expectation that 
shipping the available provenance to collaborators, or more generally publishing it along with the data, may help data consumers, including auditors, form judgements regarding the reliability of the data itself.
}

%
\paolo{
	Offering to disclose the provenance of a data as evidential basis for establishing data quality and reliability is particularly important when data products are exchanged as part of transactions that involve parties with limited mutual trust. 
This is the case for instance of \textit{dynamic coalitions}~\citep{BFJM06}, ad hoc collaborative partnerships that are created 
to pursue a common goal, in scenarios such as multi-agency emergency/threat responses, as well as the exchange of intelligence information. 
Despite the need to share data of a possibly sensitive nature, these coalitions are characterized by a lack of established interaction protocols and by limited trust amongst the partners. 
}
\paolo{
This situation creates a tension between data providers and consumers, when it comes to negotiating the level of detail of the provenance that providers are prepared to offer to consumers. 
On the one hand, consumers will require as much provenance detail as possible, to use as a basis for establishing data credibility.
Data providers, on the other hand, will be reticent to offer detailed provenance traces, because those may contain sensitive information regarding their own internal processes as well as any proprietary data used by those processes. 
%
In fact, the provenance of a data product will typically contain more sensitive information than then data product itself.}


\paolo{\subsection{Motivating scenario: provenance of intelligence information}
	%
To appreciate how such tension may arise, consider a scenario where a public agency PA  wants to buy intelligence reports, say about potential threats to the public, from an intelligence provider, IP.
%
Under assumption of limited trust, PA will want to mitigate the risk of acting upon information provided by IP, which is potentially unreliable. 
% 
At the same time, IP has a business incentive to supply PA with additional evidence that facilitates PA's risk assessment and thus increases the chance of a successful transaction.}

%
\paolo{The  key assumption that motivates our work is that the provenance of each intelligence report is relevant in contributing, at least in part, the required evidence. 
%
A fictional but realistic example of provenance for an intelligence report such information is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph-example}.
%
As depicted in the figure, provenance can be visually depicted as a digraph whose nodes represent either \textit{entities} (ovals in the figure), i.e., data, documents, etc., \textit{activities} (rectangles), which represent the execution of some process over a period of time, or \textit{agents} (pentagons), which represent  humans or computing systems. 
%
The edges represent various types of directed relationships, the most common being ``activity $a$ used entity $e$'', ``entity $e$ was generated by activity $a$'', ``activity $a$ was associated with agent $ag$'' (i.e., $ag$ was responsible for $a$), and more.}

\paolo{Formally, such a graph is a depiction of a PROV document, which in turn conforms to the W3C PROV data model~\citep{w3c-prov-dm}, introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:prov-core}. 
We will use the graph representation of provenance throughout the paper, as it facilitates reasoning about the mechanisms for provenance abstraction, which are at the core of our work.}

\paolo{
The process Reading the graph from top to bottom retains the temporal dependencies amongst its nodes, which are generated as the process

This may contain a wealth of details regarding how the report was produced, including the raw input data used for the analysis, the analytical tools and their configuration parameters, as well as the identity of the analysts involved, and their position within the business organization.  


%Second, regarding \textit{selective disclosure}, we are motivated by the emerging notion of .
%
%
%
\mnote{In this paper we develop a model and algorithm for performing  abstraction over provenance metadata. These provide the theoretical underpinning, defined on top of PROV, for applications that require provenance exchange while obfuscating some of its content.}

%The work presented in this paper is motivated 

\mnote{The recent standardisation of a data model for exchanging provenance in an interoperable way, namely the PROV model from the W3C~\citep{w3c-prov-dm}, makes this assumption realistic.}

%
While both IR and PA are interested in sending and receiving such provenance information, some of it may be sensitive and proprietary. 
%
Input datasets may include a combination of public social media streams, shown in the figure, and private databases. Likewise, analytical tools may include proprietary algorithms.
%
In a setting where mutual trust is limited, the contrast between the need to exchange provenance as a form of evidence on one side, and the need to protect confidential information that can be found in the provenance on the other, generates a tension amongst the partners.

%
We believe that such tension can be resolved by providing IR, the \textit{provenance owner}, with ways to control the disclosure of provenance to third parties. This consists of (i) a model of abstraction over provenance, whereby some of its elements are grouped together and replaced with a new, abstract element, and (ii) a policy model that the provenance owner can use to specify the  elements which are to be abstracted.
%
% These are used by the provenance owner to support a process of \emph{negotiation} with the third parties, 

The work presented here is focused exclusively on (i), while (ii)  is the subject of a separate report, focused on a user tool for the specification and enforcement of provenance abstraction policies~\citep{MBGCD14}.  
%
%
%For completeness, however, we provide a brief overview of the tool  and an example of an abstraction policy  in Sec.~\ref{sec:summary}. % Sec~\ref{sec:further} concludes.

%
%The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. After a review of related work, in Sec.~\ref{sec:prov-core} we introduce the fragment of the PROV model that defines the scope of our work, followed by an overview of the approach and summary of contributions (Sec.~\ref{sec:overview}).
%%
%The core technical material is in Sec.~\ref{sec:grouping}, where we define abstraction over provenance in terms of a \textit{grouping} operator, present its functional specification, and show that grouping maps a graph into a new graph that conforms to the same relational schema.
